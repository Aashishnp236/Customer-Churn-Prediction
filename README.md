# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project! This application utilizes machine learning models to predict which customers are likely to stop using a service. It leverages classification techniques to achieve high accuracy and provides insights into customer behavior and retention trends.

Dataset Information

The objective of this task is to predict customer churn. The task is to classify which customers are likely to stop using the service, based on data from industries such as telecom, banking, or SaaS platforms.

Formally, given a training sample of customer data and labels, where label '1' denotes the customer will churn and label '0' denotes the customer will not churn, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

For training the models, we provide datasets containing customer interaction data, including customer demographics, usage patterns, and service data.

Guidelines
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify churn patterns.

Use classification models such as:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Evaluate the models using:

Accuracy

Recall

ROC-AUC
